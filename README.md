## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:

   - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
   - The day number is not between 1-31
   - The month number is not between 1-12
   - The year is in the future
   - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile First Design
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I remember my classes about CSS grid layout, and I learn How to attach event to HTML element.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="field-section">
  <div>
    First Element
  </div>
   
  <div>
    Second Element
  </div>

  <div>
    Third Element
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
.field-section {
  width: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  column-gap: 15px;
}

div {
  height: 50px;
  border: 2px purple solid;
}
```

```js
document.addEventListener('submit', () => {
  console.log("I'm called when you form content !");
})
```

### Continued development

For the rest I would like to core with advanced notions of JavaScript and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. I really liked this editor and will use it going forward.  Visual Studio Code is free.
- [Dynamisez vos sites
   web avec Javascript !](https://user.oc-static.com/pdf/309961-dynamisez-vos-sites-web-avec-javascript.pdf) - This is an amazing cours which helped me finally understand how to make site reactive with JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning JavaScript. [For more course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/)
